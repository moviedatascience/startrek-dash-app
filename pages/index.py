Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container,
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash
the content.

            ## DATA Driven Storytelling

            The writers room for Star Trek: The Next Generation has a problem.

            They've been renewed for an eighth season, but it's been so long since
            they last wrote a script they don't know where to start. ðŸ›¸

             The producer has come to you with a simple request:

            ```"Let me know if there's any correlation between how much a character spoke and the audience reception of the episode." ```

            In order to give an informed response we need to:

            * Explore the data
            * Create a model and
            * Test the model accuracy

            ***

            View the video to understand the general line distribution for all characters
            over the course of the series, then click the Explore Data button when you are ready to begin.
